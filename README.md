# Streamify

> ⚠️ WIP: Not ready for production use yet, just started development on this project.

Streamify is a self-hosted video-on-demand platform designed to give streamers, 
content creators, and video enthusiasts full control over their 
video hosting. Unlike traditional platforms, Streamify 
allows you to host your own videos on your own server, 
maintaining complete control over your content, branding, 
and user management, all without the need for hiring developers.
